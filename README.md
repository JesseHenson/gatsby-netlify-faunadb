- [Setup Gatsby with Netlify Functions](https://employbl.com/blog/setup-gatsby-with-netlify-functions): In this tutorial weâ€™re going to build an application that submits a form with React.js and triggers an AWS Lambda function with Netlify.

## Getting started

In one tab run `gatsby develop` this will run the UI on `http://localhost:8000`.

In another tab from project root run `npm run serve:lambda`. This will help us with the proxy and running our Netlify Functions locally.
